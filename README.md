# US_State_Challenge

Description

The US State Challenge is a game made in Python using turtle and pandas that allows users to practice their knowledge of US states. 
The objective of the challenge is for users to guess each of the states using a blank map of the United States. Each successful guess
will result in a guessed state being labelled. If the user is not able to guess all 50 states, a csv will be generated that will list 
the states not guessed for additional practice.

Future Features
- Ability to reset the game for another attempt
